tadoschedule
============

tado multi temperature scheduling utility

At the moment, the tado smart thermometer web and mobile apps only allow a single home temperature to be set.  This is a simple python3 script to allow the home temperature to be changed at defined times.

Having only learned python in the last day I'm sure this code can be massively improved!

Python package dependencies: httplib2, schedule, sqllite3, time

Tested with python v3.4.0 only
